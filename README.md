This repository contains a simple Dart program that demonstrates an IndexOutOfBoundsException and its solution. The `bug.dart` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a corrected version.

The error occurs when attempting to access an element in a list using an index that is outside the valid range of indices. In this case, a list of size 5 is accessed with index 6, leading to the exception. The solution involves adding robust error handling to prevent the program from crashing.
